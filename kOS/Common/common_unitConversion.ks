// kg - kilograms
// gR - anyone using this is clearly trying to use an ion thruster (and doesnt want their burn done in the lifetime of the universe :) I am using gR as notation because 9.81 exists and this is a space game (i know gR can be gravity too but ok)
// lbs - sadly not money (Pounds)

// all of these are actually taken from the windows calculator so report inaccuracies to the developers of windows not me, though garbage in garbage out applies to make this work as if we convert using the same dataset we should come out with the same answer regardless even if one of the values has been converted incorrectly, converting it back should still give the original value!
